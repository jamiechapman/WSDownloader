WSDownloader
============

A tiny, one-liner networking library built on top of NSURLSession and AFNetworking. Therefore, it has AFNetworking as a dependency.

Okay, so what's it for?
=====
For downloading an uploading stuff to the internets from your iOS or Mac app.

Is it tested?
=====
Well, I use it in production. I haven't written unit tests so I can't guarantee anything. If you think it sucks, you're free to do so. But it'd be cool if you'd tell me why, or make a pull request.
